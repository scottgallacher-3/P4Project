    "\n",
    "There are many scientific and engineering applications in which the thickness of bonds between two component's surfaces is an important factor. Particularly, this is highly relevant in designing Gravitational Wave detectors, where very small signals have to be differentiated from background noise sources - of which the bonds are major contributors. In fact, when building detectors a maximum peak-to-valley height of 60 nanometres is targeted for bonds between affixed components.\n",
